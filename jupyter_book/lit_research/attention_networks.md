### Attention Network Theory (Posner and Rothbart, 2007 Model for the integration of  psychological science)

based on D.O. Hebb, 1949 the  organization of behavior
Alterting, Orienting, Control as segregated networks

Anatomy of three attentional networks: alerting, orienting, and executive attention (from Posner & Rothbart 2007).
```

def :

* Alterting : achieving and maintaining a state of high sensitivity to incoming stimuli
* Orienting: selection of inoming information from sensory input (overt (includes eye movement, and covert))
* Executive attention: monitoring and resolving conflicts among thought feelings, responses (stroop task for conflict)

Based on networks identified with ANT test (combines the Flanker Test and Posner cuing task (Posner, 1989))

:gutter: 3

:::{grid-item-card} Alerting

* Thalamus
* Frontal
* Parietal regions
* manipulation: warining signals prior to target in tasks
* neuromodulator : acetylcholine (Marrocco & Davidson 1998)
  
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Orienting

* Posterior regions
* In monkeys : lateral intraparietal area (LIP) related (resp. for eye movements)
* Superior parietal (influence of cue) (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002)
* Temporal perietal junction (disengagement from cued location)
* Frontal eye field
* Superior colliculus
* manipulation: place cue in location where target is likely to occur
* neuromodulator: Norepinephrine

:::

:::{grid-item-card} Executive

* Anterior cingulate (increased conn. with sensory area processing conflict)
* Lateral prefrontal (see [markett](markett_2021) for against lateralization)
* Prefrontal
* Basal ganglia
* manipulation: conflict (e.g. Stroop task)
* neuromodulator: Dopamine

#### Relationship with genetics

(Fan et al 2001) found (studies with twins)

* strong heritability in exectutive network
* some heritability in orienting network
* no heritability in altering network

(Fossela et al, 2002) : check association with

* dopamine 4 receptor
* monoamine oxidase 4 genes

comparing expression and performance on ANT test

found major differences between groups with different alleles in:

* performance on ANT
* activations in anterior cingulate cortex (major humb in executive)

(see page 9 for more examples of genes)
check p. 10 for diagram of ANT-R task

(see Rothback and Rueda, 2005 , Rutff & Rothbat 1996 for relation attention and emotional and behavioral control)

Rueda et al 2004 for version of ANT test adapted for children
Same ref : ability to resolve conflict in flanker task (ANT) remains about the same from age 8 to adulthood

Mechnisms of self regulatio show similar time course, with advances between age 2 and 5.
Effects of training on ANT task performance : higher increase in children with initially worse perfromance

### Revisiting the segregated network hypothesis

#### Hypothesis tested

* Dorsal fronto-parietal network
* Ventral fronto parietal attention network
* fronto-parietal network control
